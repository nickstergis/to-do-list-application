To-Do List Application
This application is a task management and reminder system for users.

As a user, I can:
Register for an account
Log in to my account
View all my completed and pending tasks
Create a task or reminder (e.g., supermarket)
Update a task
Delete a task
Complete a task
Record specific actions related to a task or reminder (e.g., after selecting the already created task "supermarket," I can enter details about what I want to doâ€”such as buying eggs, milk, bread, etc.)
Update specific actions
Delete specific actions
Complete specific actions
View a history of all my activities (e.g., when I registered, when I added/updated/deleted a task, etc.)
The application consists of:
Database: A database of your choice (recommended: MySQL or MS SQL for relational databases, MongoDB for NoSQL databases).
Front-end: A user interface web application where users can perform the functions mentioned above. Suggested technologies include Angular or HTML, CSS, JavaScript (either vanilla JavaScript or jQuery).
Back-end: A server application that mediates between the front-end application and the database. The server application should be implemented in Node.js using either JavaScript or TypeScript.
